Adit is competing in the the Virtuleap WebVR Hackathon to support further
exploration of data analysis in VR. These are some of the features I could add if Adit wins the competition:
<ul>
 <li>Save State: save and share your created data visualizations</li>
 <li>Telepresence: invite others to join you in VR or on monitors to 
 collaborate on or present visualizations</li>
 <li>4D: map 4 positional variables and view a projection of the 4D space in VR</li>
 <li>Plot Types: create line, ellipsoid, stacked volume plots, and more</li>
 <li>Model Diagnostics: examine residuals of multiple predictors simultaneously to discover interaction effects</li>
 <li>A-Frame Components: extract more functionality from Adit to share with 
 the WebVR community, like

 </ul>
