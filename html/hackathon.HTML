Dear Virtuleap Hackathon Judges,<br />
Thank you for your consideration. Adit offers a full suite of exploratory data 
analysis features for the HTC Vive. Please explore with one of the provided 
datasets or upload your own. If you don't have a Vive available, you can see
a demonstration of the interactive data analysis 
<strong><a href="https://youtu.be/vy8e8zIi4qw">in this brief video</a></strong>.<br />
If adit is selected as the hackathon winner, here are some exmaples of
directions I would explore for VR data analysis as a productivity tool:
<ul>
 <li>Save State: save and share your created data visualizations</li>
 <li>Telepresence: invite others to join you in VR or on monitors to 
 collaborate on or present visualizations</li>
 <li>4D: map 4 positional variables and view a projection of the 4D space in VR</li>
 <li>Plot Types: create line, ellipsoid, stacked volume plots, and more</li>
 <li>Model Diagnostics: examine residuals of multiple predictors simultaneously to discover interaction effects</li>
 <li>A-Frame Components: extract more functionality from Adit to share with 
 the WebVR community, like

</ul>
